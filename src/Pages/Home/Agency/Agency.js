                <h1>The Best Travel Agency</h1>
                <p>Travel agents sell transportation, lodging, and admission to entertainment activities to individuals and groups planning trips. They offer advice on destinations, plan trip itineraries, and make travel arrangements for clients. There are about 50 OTAs operating in Bangladesh at this moment. This tells that there is a minimal level of awareness in the market. This is a welcome development so to say. The thing now we need to pay attention to is offering proper customer service so that people trust OTAs and they use the service. Examples of online travel agencies include Expedia, Booking.com and Travelocity. Some OTAs, such as Google Flights, specialise in one single service, as opposed to all services related to travel.</p>
